"""
Typed dictionaries, dataclasses, and type aliases shared by every AdvCP
attack module.

The aliases defined here are meant to make type signatures elsewhere in
the package self-documenting. They use ``TypeAlias`` (not ``NewType``):
the goal is readability, not strict subtype enforcement, so passing a
plain ``str`` where a semantic alias is expected does not require
explicit wrapping.

See the package README for how these types fit together end-to-end.

        Attack mode.

    default_size : Sequence of float
        Box size used when an entry under ``boxes`` does not override it.

        gradient quality when the model is sensitive to feature
        coordinates).
    init : bool

        a synthetic mesh into the attacker's lidar before extracting
        the base perturbation tensor.
    online : bool
        Intermediate fusion: persist the best perturbation across

        ``True``.
    model_path, mesh_divide_path : str
        Backwards-compatible aliases honoured by ``load_config``.
    asset_runtime_generation : bool
        Generate the car mesh / divide (and, with ``advshape``, removal
        assets) on demand instead of using the asset bundle. See
        ``opencda.core.attack.advcp.utils.runtime_assets``.
    asset_cache_dir : str
        Optional directory for reusable generated assets, keyed by a hash
        of all generation inputs.
    vehicle_blueprint : str
        CARLA blueprint whose approximate dimensions size the generated
        generic box mesh.

        Explicit ``(length, width, height)`` of the generated mesh;
